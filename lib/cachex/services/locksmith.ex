  # This module controls the ETS table backing the LockManager. It should be noted
  # that this table acts as a global lock table against all caches. This is due
  # to the desire that an ETS table is a fairly expensive construct to store only
  # a few keys. Because of this we have a global table and just tag the record
  # in the table with the namespace of the cache it was written by. This table
  # will typically be very small (as locks are cleaned up as they go). It should
  # also be noted that this behaviour could easily live in a GenServer were it
  # not for the speedup when using ETS. When using an ETS table this check is
  # typically 0.3-0.5Âµs/op whereas a GenServer is roughly 10x this.
