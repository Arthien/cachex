defmodule Cachex.Stats do
  @moduledoc """
  Hook module to control the gathering of cache statistics.

  This implementation of statistics tracking uses a hook to run asynchronously
  against a cache (so that it doesn't impact those who don't want it). It executes
  as a post hook and provides a solid example of what a hook can/should look like.

  This hook has zero knowledge of the cache it belongs to; it keeps track of an
  internal set of statistics based on the provided messages. This means that it
  can also be mocked easily using raw server calls to `handle_notify/3`.
