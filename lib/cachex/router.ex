  Routing module to dispatch Cachex actions to their execution environment.

  This module acts as the single source of dispatch within Cachex. In prior
  versions the backing actions were called directly from the main interface
  and were wrapped in macros, which was difficult to maintain and also quite
  noisy. Now that all execution flows via the router, this is no longer an
  issue and it also serves as a gateway to distribution in the future.
