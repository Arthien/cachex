  Validation module for records defined in the specification.

  This module just exposes runtime validation functions for records defined
  in the spec; records themselves only determine keys and structure but cannot
  enforce type (that I know of) without additional runtime validations.

  This shouldn't be used outside of the library, but it can be if required.
