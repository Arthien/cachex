  Command module to enable basic retrieval of cache entries.

  This command provides very little over the raw read actions provided by the
  `Cachex.Actions` module, as most of the heavy lifting is done in there. The
  only modification made is that the value is extracted, rather than returning
  the entire entry.

  The returned value will be wrapped in a tagged Tuple to communicate

  the `:missing` tag, the value was not found.
