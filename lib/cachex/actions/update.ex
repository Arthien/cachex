  Updates a value inside the cache.

  Updates do not affect the touch time of a record, which is what makes an update
  call useful. If you need to update the touch time, immediately call the Touch
  action after an update.

  This action executes inside a Transaction to ensure that there are no keys currently
  under a lock - thus ensuring consistency.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
