  Retrieves the remaining TTL for a cache item.

  If the cache item has no TTL, a nil value is returned. If the item is missing,
  a nil is returned, tagged with a :missing flag. Otherwise a Tuple of :ok and
  the remaining time to list (in milliseconds) is returned.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
