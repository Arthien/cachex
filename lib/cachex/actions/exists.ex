  @doc """
  Checks if an item exists in a cache.

  We simply return true of false if membership is detected. This operation has
  to do a read in order to validate that the TTL has expired, so we delegate to
  the generic read action to do the lifting for us.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
