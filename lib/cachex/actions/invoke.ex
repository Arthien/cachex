  # key of the Cache struct. Invocations which modify are carried out inside a
  # Transaction context to ensure consistency. Please see the project documentation
  # for more details.

  @doc """
  Invokes a custom command on a cache.

  This allows the developer to attach common functions directly to the cache, in
  order to easily share logic around a codebase without having to write a module.

  Invocation passes the value for a given key through to the custom command, and
  takes action based on the type of command being executed and the return value
  of the command.

  There are currently no options accepted here, but it's required as an argument
  in order to future-proof the arity.
