  # new operations. To ensure that this is the case, we sleep inside a transaction
  # which blocks the increment outside. The increment happens whilst there is still
  # 40ms left in the sleep inside the transaction, but it returns 2 - meaning that
  # it was queued until after the transaction had finished sleeping and written
  # the value for the first time.
