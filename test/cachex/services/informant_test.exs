  # This test ensures that Hook notifications function correctly, trying various
  # Hook types and execution patterns. If the hook executes before the action,
  # we only ever receive the action as the message, as results will often not
  # exist. This is true if we use a post hook without the results flag set to true.
  # We also verify that non-async hooks block the chain of execution whilst they
  # wait for a response. This behaviour will be improved in future to clean up
  # after itself, but for now it's sufficient to validate a rough timeout - we
  # allow a delta of 10ms just because of Erlang's timers not being overly accurate.
